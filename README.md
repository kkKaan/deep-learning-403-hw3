# CENG403 - Spring 2024 - THE3

This repository contains three tasks as part of the CENG403 course, designed to provide hands-on experience with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning using PyTorch. The tasks include implementing naive convolution and pooling operations, building a CNN with PyTorch, and finetuning a pretrained ResNet18 for CIFAR10.

## Project Structure

- `CENG403_THE3_Part1.ipynb`: Implementation of naive convolution and pooling operations.
- `CENG403_THE3_Part2.ipynb`: Implementation of a CNN using PyTorch.
- `CENG403_THE3_Part3.ipynb`: Finetuning a pretrained ResNet18 for CIFAR10.

## Task 1: Naive Convolution and Pooling Implementation

### Objective

Implement convolution and pooling operations manually to understand their inner workings, including both forward and backward passes.

### Files Overview

#### `CENG403_THE3_Part1.ipynb`

- **Import the Modules**: Importing necessary Python libraries.
- **Implementing Convolution Operation**: Step-by-step implementation of the convolution operation.
- **Implementing Pooling Operation**: Step-by-step implementation of the pooling operation.
- **Backpropagation**: Implementing the backpropagation for both convolution and pooling layers.

### Usage

Open and run `CENG403_THE3_Part1.ipynb` directly in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Follow the instructions and cells sequentially to understand and execute the code.

## Task 2: CNN Implementation with PyTorch

### Objective

Implement and train a CNN using PyTorch, including defining the network architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

### Files Overview

#### `CENG403_THE3_Part2.ipynb`

- **Import the Modules**: Importing necessary Python libraries and PyTorch modules.
- **Building the CNN**: Defining the architecture of the CNN.
- **Training the CNN**: Training the CNN on a dataset.
- **Evaluating the Model**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model.

### Usage

## Task 3: Finetuning ResNet18 for CIFAR10

### Objective

Adapt and finetune a ResNet18 model, pretrained on ImageNet, for the CIFAR10 dataset. This includes loading the pretrained model, modifying it for CIFAR10, and training the modified model.

### Files Overview

#### `CENG403_THE3_Part3.ipynb`

- **Download and Test Pretrained ResNet18**: Downloading and testing the pretrained ResNet18 model.
- **Adapting ResNet18 for CIFAR10**: Modifying the model architecture to suit the CIFAR10 dataset.
- **Finetuning the Model**: Training the adapted model on CIFAR10.
- **Evaluating the Model**: Evaluating the performance of the finetuned model.

### Usage
